# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

## Do NOT touch the live Blender session

A Blender **GUI session has `scenes/supermarket.blend` open** (since 2026-09-06)
with its MCP socket listening on `localhost:9876`. Do **not** close, kill or save
over it, do **not** run `scripts/launch_blender.sh`, and do **not** write to
`scenes/*.blend`. Reading those files is fine. Do all headless verification with
`blender -b … --python …` writing to a **scratch output path**, never into the
repo's `scenes/`, `export/` or `renders/`.

## Orientation

- **[README.md](README.md)** — the design (why the store is generated), the four
  stages (catalog → planogram → labels → scene), what the base scene carries, the
  cameras, the USD export, the file policy, and a dated decision log.
- **[RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md)** — every command (launch, MCP, regenerate, render,
  export). Don't duplicate commands elsewhere; point here.
- **File policy**: an artifact is gitignored only when its regeneration is both
  offline AND cheap (seconds–minute) — built scene, labels/signs, `export/`.
  Versioned: the base scene + `assets/textures/` (network), `report_assets/`,
  `scripts/planogram.json`, and the GPU-hour render evidence (`renders/`,
  `walkthrough.mp4`, `report.html`). See README's file-policy table (with measured
  costs) before adding or committing any large file.
- **[docs/isaac_robot_in_store.md](docs/isaac_robot_in_store.md)** — standing the
  fleet's UR10 in the export under Isaac Sim (`scripts/compose_robot_in_store.py`).
  Its `--report-usd` / `--dry-run` read the USD and author the collider/spawn plan
  with **no GPU boot** (safe beside Blender); a real run boots Isaac Sim and is
  gated by a GPU guard that refuses beside the live Blender session. Pure logic is
  unit tested under `scripts/twin/tests/` (run under `env_isaaclab`; the
  Isaac-bundled `pxr` needs no simulator boot to read the stage).
- **Validate the USD offline (no GPU)**: `scripts/validate_usd.py` (RUNBOOK §6a) opens
  the export with a CPU-only `usd-core` venv and proves it is Isaac-loadable (up-axis,
  scale, default prim, every texture/reference resolves, composer prim paths). Run it
  after every `export_usd.py`. Known standing defect it flags: the export authors 6
  dangling floor/wall textures (MCP Poly Haven maps backed by `tmp*.jpg`); fixed in
  `export_usd.py`, needs a re-export — write-up in `data/twin-usd-validate-v1/report.md`.
- **Path caveat**: the Blender-run scripts hardcode `~/workspaces/blender-supermarket`
  as the project root; the PIL scripts use script-relative paths.
- Local-only project: **no git remote** — never push or open a PR.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
